/* remember that in the google chrome console we where typing for example 2 + 2 and immediately we where getting an answer back. In js files we won't be getting the answer back. We have to somehow manually print it. How? By using the console.log() method. */

console.log(2 + 2); // what this will do is: print 4 to the console

// another thing we can print to the console is an error! 

console.error("[!] Oh no, we got an error.");

// also we can pass multiple things to console.log() 

console.log(3 + 4, "hello", true);
